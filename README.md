You need to download the IMDB dataset in order to run this model by yourself. Please download the data here https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

Click on the mybinder badge to start interacting with the code in a separate environment on mybinder. 

# Usage

Please notice that you need to download the dataset and put it in the data folder in order to run the model locally. The dataset is huge therefore I could not store it directly on github!.


In order to run the code, you need to install the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt. 
To do this please run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies using pip package manager. 

After that, you should be able to run the code.

If you are opening this on mybinder, you can run `!pip install -r requirements.txt` in a jupyter-notebook cell to install all dependencies directly in the notebook.
After that, you shuold be able to run the code on mybinder
